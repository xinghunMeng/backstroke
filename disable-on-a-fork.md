# Disable Backstroke on a fork

1. Take a look at any pull request that backstroke has made. Ensure that it is currently open.
2. Create a label titled `optout` - all one word.
3. Give the previously specified pull request the label `optout`.
4. Close the pull request. Backstroke shouldn't bug you anymore.

If you're removing backstroke for a specific reason, please
[tell me more](https://github.com/backstrokeapp/server/issues/new).
